# Project Description

Repository contains files for BF528 Project 2 for Group 5. It contains R scripts used by the group members, output files, and the final report.  

For this project, we attempted to recreate the study, 'Transcriptional Reversion of Cardiac Myocyte Fate During Mammalian Cardiac Regeneration'. In this study, the authors investigated the dedifferentiation, differentiation and regeneration of cardiomyocytes by profiling global gene expression patterns in various mice models. We attempted to recreate the RNASeq analysis and compare our results with the those of the studys.
